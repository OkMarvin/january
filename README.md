## Usage

Adds this package to your okmarvin project and configures `_config.toml` to use it:

```toml
theme = "@okmarvin/january"
```

Make sure to put logo image into `okmarvin project/public/static/img` folder.

## Develop

Clone this repo and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/OkMarvin/january.git
$ cd january
$ npm install
```

Run `npm start` to start development server.

## Build for production

Just run `npm run build`.

But there are some requirements when you build theme for okmarvin:

1. Please use `webpack` to build assets even though we use Parcel for development
2. `main` field in `package.json` should point to a `manifest.json` file generated by `webpack` plugin

## note

1. Not using react-router-dom because of this [issue](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/6789#issuecomment-502490351)
